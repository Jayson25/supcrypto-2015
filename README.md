# Supcrypto 2015

## Caracteristics
This project allows to encrypt images and hide text into images. During this project, we learned how to do the XOR on pixels, how to use an equation to encrypt or decrypt an image, and finally how to hide a UTF-8 text into the pixels without changing the quality of the image.

## Tools for this project
We use python to program this project, as well as Numpy, a mathematical libray and pygame, a graphic API. To edit the code, we use notepad++ with the python colours as well as the CMD console.

## Bonuses added to this project
We created a GUI interface for the project, to make the correction of the prof easier (easier navigation, and no command line to enter). To make the interface work, you must install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/">pywin32</a>. It allows to select a file using the windows explorer. Finally, we implement a webcam fonctionality (very primative), where you can take photos with your webcam and encrypt it.
